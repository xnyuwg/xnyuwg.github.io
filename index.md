Welcome to my personal space! 

I recently completed my PhD from the [Department of Computer Science](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/), [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/), where I was also a visiting PhD student at the [Department of Informatics](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/informatics), [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/).
Before the PhD adventure, I studied at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. 

I also worked as an Applied Scientist Intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) focusing on Large Language Models, as an Algorithm Engineer at the [XiaoAi](https://xiaoai.mi.com/) Group of [Xiaomi](https://www.mi.com/global/), and as a Research Intern at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/).

I currently focus on LLMs, especially Reasoning, Multi-Agent, and Efficiency. In the past, I have worked on Long-Context Understanding, Dialogue System, and Multi-modality.
