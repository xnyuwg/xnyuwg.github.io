Welcome to my personal space! I am currently a PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/), [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/), and as a visiting PhD student at the [Department of Informatics](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/informatics), [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/), under the guidance of [Prof. Yulan He](https://sites.google.com/view/yulanhe/home) and [Dr. Lin Gui](https://sites.google.com/view/lin-gui/).

Before the PhD adventure, I finished my M.S. at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and my B.E. at both [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) (First Class Honours) and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. 

Besides that, I had an internship at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) as Research Intern for two months. I had a full-time work for about one year as Algorithm Engineer at the XiaoAi Group of [Xiaomi](https://www.mi.com/global/) developing [XiaoAi](https://xiaoai.mi.com/) (a virtual assistant comparable to Siri). I will start an internship as Applied Scientist Intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) in August.

Currently, my focus is on long context understanding and efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Since 2024, my focus has shifted to LLMs, including work related to multi-task learning. Prior to this, I concentrated on long document understanding using language models. Before that, my master's degree centered on multi-modality and machine reading comprehension.
