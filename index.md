Welcome to my personal space! I am currently a PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/), [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/), and as a visiting researcher at the [Department of Informatics](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/informatics), [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/), under the guidance of [Prof. Yulan He](https://sites.google.com/view/yulanhe/home) and [Dr. Lin Gui](https://sites.google.com/view/lin-gui/).

Before the PhD adventure, I finished my M.S. at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and my B.E. at both [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. Besides that, I also spent a year with the XiaoAi Group at [Xiaomi Inc.](https://www.mi.com/global/) developing [XiaoAi](https://xiaoai.mi.com/) (a virtual assistant comparable to Siri).

My research focuses on natural language processing, especially for long document understanding. Now, I am also interested in exploring Large Language Models (LLM) and Generative AI.
